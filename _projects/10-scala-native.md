[Sbt-cross-project](https://github.com/scala-native/sbt-crossproject)
  We extended Scala.jsâ€™ crossProject and %%% to support Scala-Native. You can publish and depend on Scala Native libraries.

  [Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLpwa7Uz0mKzldBlalkTh1zI1OoEwWlrMFrqnDc6x_M/edit?ts=57d7ee43) We are implementing JDK core libraries based on open source usage. We are building libraries from the Scala Index against Scala Native and we implement the missing methods.
